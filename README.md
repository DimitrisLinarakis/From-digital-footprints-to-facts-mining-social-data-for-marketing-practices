# Instagram scraper

## Overview
This tool enables its users to extract public data from Instagram profiles and calculate, through a strictly defined procedure, metrics that are linked to the performance of both profiles (content creators) and posts.

The present tool is a key part of my dissertation with the title of *"From digital footprints to facts: mining social data for marketing practices"*, through which conclusions are drawn for the Greek Instagram community in three areas: 

- The behavior and preferences of the Greek Instagram & YouTube community 
- The tactics with which businesses operate on Instagram and YouTube
- The impact of COVID-19 virus on digital behavior of the users

## Useful Tools
- Python 3.6+
- Scrapy framework
- Web browser (recommended: Chrome or Mozilla browser)
- MongoDB
